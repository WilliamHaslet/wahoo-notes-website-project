This was my semester project for the Advanced Software Development course at the University of Virginia in Fall of 2021.

This project was a web app that made it easy for students to share notes with other students in their classes. A user could log in with single sign-on using their university Google account, search classes to build their schedule, find other students in their classes, and upload notes to share.

The project was completed in a team of five. My primary responsibilities were the configuration of class data, managing deployment automation, and creating Django testing classes that would run during the continuous integration process.

The tools used include Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, Bootstrap, Heroku, Git, and GitHub Actions.
